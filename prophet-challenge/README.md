# prophet-challenge

This project was evaluating as a growth analyst for Mercado Libre, and evaluating search patterns in traffic history answering questions and then modeling out what the future of the search Traffic could look like. 

During this project, I used the class files from Module 8 as a reference point to do the prophet modeling and to help answer the questions. When I am graphing out the model I like to put the lines on separate lines of code to more easily edit the graphs, and I think if there are collaborator they can make edits more easily too. 

First I looked for unusual patterns in the hourly search data, and then looked at how the search traffic data had any correlation to stock prices and measured that with Stock Valtility. 

Then moved on to Time series modeling with Prophet to see what the forecasts would look like.
